# Dotfiles

These dotfiles are managed using
[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/stow.html).

## Installation

Clone and install:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/robbert-vdh/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ ./install.sh
```

## Emacs configuration

My Emacs configuration is based on [Doom
Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs). The files in
`usr/emacs/.emacs.d` can simply be copied or symlinked to wherever Doom is
installed.
