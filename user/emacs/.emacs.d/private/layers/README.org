These layers are meant to be used with Spacemacs' development branch. They might
require some minor modifications to work on the stable release.

You can use these layers by either cloning the entire repository and symlinking
the layers to =~/.emacs.d/private/layers=, or by simply copying the layers over:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # Method one
  git clone https://github.com/robbert-vdh/dotfiles.git ~/.spacemacs-layers
  ln -s ~/.spacemacs-layers/user/emacs/.emacs.d/private/layers/<layer> ~/.emacs.d/private/layers/<layer>

  # Method two
  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/robbert-vdh/dotfiles.git /tmp/spacemacs-layers
  mv /tmp/spacemacs-layers/user/emacs/.emacss.d/private/layers/<layer> ~/.emacs.d/private/layers/<layer>
#+END_SRC
